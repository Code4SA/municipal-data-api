            The website is designed to present key municipal financial information to a general audience, who do not necessarily have any financial background or knowledge.

            Municipal Money contains user–friendly, reliable and comparable financial information for every single municipality in South Africa.

            The <a href="https://municipaldata.treasury.gov.za">Municipal Money API</a> contains the raw data used in the Municipal Money website application, and much more.   All municipalities are required to regularly submit their financial information to National Treasury, who in partnership with Code for South Africa is making it available to the public through the API, in a machine-friendly format.

            Municipal Money is brought to you by the National Treasury, which has collected extensive municipal financial data over several years and would like to share this information with the public in order to increase transparency, strengthen civic oversight and promote accountability.

          What is a municipal financial year? <a href="#what-is-a-municipal-financial-year" class="faq-anchor"><i class="fa fa-paragraph" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            A financial year is an organisation’s accounting period of 12 consecutive months, at the end of which the accounting books or records for that period are closed.  The financial year is used as a basis for planning, budgeting, measuring financial performance and financial reporting.  
          </p><p>
The financial year for South African municipalities runs from 1 July of each year to 30 June of the following year.  Budgets need to be prepared and approved for each financial year.  At the close of the financial year, reporting against the approved or adjusted (if any) budget is required in the form of Annual Financial Statements and an Annual report.

      <div class="faq-item" id="what-is-a-financial-quarter">
        <div class="faq-question">
          What is a financial quarter and why is some of the data presented quarterly (rather than annually)? <a href="#what-is-a-financial-quarter" class="faq-anchor"><i class="fa fa-paragraph" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
          A "quarter" is a 3-month period in a financial year and is often expressed as q1, q2, q3 or  q4.  A quarter is usually accompanied by the year it relates to.  For example, "2016 q1" refers to the first quarter of the 2016 financial year (2015-2016).  Since the municipal financial year begins in July of one year and ends in June of the following year, the period being referred to here is July-Sep 2015.
          </p><p>
While most of the financial data provided to National Treasury  by the municipalities is submitted annually, some data is refreshed and submitted on a quarterly basis.  Quarterly updates are important for planning and monitoring purposes and acts as an early warning system.  For example, quarterly figures could show that the municipality was not collecting nearly enough of the money owed to it in order to cover its debts.  Rather than waiting for annual financial figures to reveal this, the quarterly information allows the municipality to identify a problem and take corrective action sooner.

          <p>
            When something is listed as ‘Not Available’, one or more of the things needed to show the indicator for that date was missing from National Treasury's local government database. This usually happens when the relevant municipality has not submitted the data to the National Treasury in an acceptable form in time. It might have been submitted late and will be available in the next quarter. It might also be available directly from the municipality but without the vetting done by National Treasury before inclusion in their local government database.

          <i>Similar municipalities</i> are those municipalities in the same Municipal Infrastructure and Investment Framework (MIIF) category.
          This is a widely-used categorisation of municipalities that allows one to make comparisons between municipalities of similar capacity.
          </p><p>
          When we calculate an indicator comparison for similar municipalities, we use the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median" target="_blank">median value</a>
          of the municipalities in the same MIIF category.

        <div class="faq-question">
          What are the potential limitations of the datasets and their interpretation? <a href="#limitations" class="faq-anchor"><i class="fa fa-paragraph" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            Users should be aware that the data is submitted to National Treasury directly from the individual municipalities and while National Treasury endeavours to ensure that the datasets are complete and validated regularly, ultimately the quality of the data is primarily assured by the Chief Accounting Officer of the municipality.
          </p>
          <p>
            National Treasury has developed standard indicators and norms based on the Section 71 submissions of municipalities, and these indicators and norms have been used as a basis to compare the financial performance of different municipalities on the Municipal Money website.  However, there are occasions when municipal financial performance cannot clearly be classified within these accepted norms and where deviations from the norms are not necessarily a negative reflection on the municipality’s financial performance.
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, some metropolitan municipalities, with their large populations and substantive budgets, may opt to adopt different strategies of service delivery as compared with their counterparts.  This in turn, may involve more outsourcing, less capital expenditure and lower staff costs  - all of which, may then fall outside of the generally accepted norms and standards identified by National Treasury.
          </p>
          <p>
            While we acknowledge these limitations, National Treasury believes that these comparisons are still useful and appropriate as they allow users to identify and explore the differences between municipalities – bringing them closer to understanding the sometimes subtle nuances between municipalities and between categories of municipalities.
          </p>
          <p>
            To assist users in querying the results of a municipality’s financial indicators, Municipal Money provides a direct email link to the municipal management, where the Municipal Manager and Mayor may respond directly and provide clarification to users.
          </p>
          <p>
            This level of interest and understanding will no doubt contribute to enhanced civic oversight, greater transparency and increased accountability.

          What is a mashup? <a href="#mashups" class="faq-anchor"><i class="fa fa-paragraph" aria-hidden="true"></i></a>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
          <p>
            A mashup is a web page or application created by combining data or functionality from different sources to create a single new service.  This new service or functionality usually falls outside of envisaged use of the original applications.  Mashups also typically utilize visualisations – pictures that show the data in clear, imaginative ways and tell a story about the underlying information.  
          </p>
          <p>
            For example, a mashup combining data sources such as electoral lists and a mapping tool could show where votes are being cast and for which political parties. This would be of interest to voters and political representatives.
          </p>
          <p>
            We hope that the data from the Municipal Money API will be used in mashups with other data sources to create innovative, new, interesting and valuable applications for municipal financial data.
